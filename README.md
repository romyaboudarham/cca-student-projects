Selected student final and exhibition pieces with software/hardware components I designed and implemented

## Jumping For Joy - Interactive LED Color Mathing Lamp
Student ask: How do I control the red, green, and blue values of an LED using flexible sliders


- single led not bright enough
- pivoted to neopixel 12 led right, using neopixel led library
- the flex potentiometer was noisy at either end so we adjusted the range to flatten out edge values
